    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm <b>RANI LODHA</b>, a passionate and coder based in the heart of the digital world. I thrive on turning ideas into visually stunning and user-friendly websites that leave a lasting impact.
      
        With a Bachelor's degree in <b>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</b> , I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JAVA, and Python. My goal is to craft intuitive and seamless user experiences that delight and engage visitors.
      
        I have a deep appreciation for the balance between aesthetics and functionality. My design philosophy revolves around simplicity and elegance, creating websites that not only look great but also work flawlessly across different devices and browsers.
      
        Each project has taught me something new and reinforced my commitment to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends.
      
        When I'm not pushing pixels or writing code, you'll find me exploring new design inspiration,painting or reading some novels.
      
        I'm always excited to take on new challenges and bring fresh ideas to life. Let's work together to create an online presence that reflects your vision and sets you apart from the competition. Feel free to get in touch; I'd love to hear about your next project!</p>
